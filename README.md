# First Resume
This code is a personal project, it contains all of the source code of the oldest finished version of my resume.

During my free time, I have decided to learn on openclassroom the basics of the HTML/CSS web programming languages, in order to create the first static version of my resume in french, english and spanish.
To first load it in french, just open the "CV.html" file on your browser, and you will be able to browse into my first personal website.
